# Solar System Simulator 🌌

This simulator allows you to explore our solar system in 3D. You can interact with planets, zoom in and out, and observe their orbits in real-time. It's a fun and educational way to learn about the movements and characteristics of the planets and other celestial objects in our solar system.

### ✨ Features
- 🌍 3D View of the Solar System: View all the planets, moons, and the Sun from different angles.
- 🔄 Planet Orbits: Planets move in their orbits around the Sun in real-time.
- 🌑 Interactive Controls: Zoom in, rotate, and pan to explore the solar system from various perspectives.
- 🌠 OpenGL Rendering: Efficient, smooth, and high-performance rendering using OpenGL.
